### remake of [https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-coloring-with-networkx](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-coloring-with-networkx-88c45f09b8f4) in julia
* [part_A](graph-coloring-with-networkx/part_A.ipynb) 
  * basic Graph.jl usage
* [part_B](graph-coloring-with-networkx/part_B.ipynb)
  * a simple backtracking/exhaustive search solution

### refining graphcol_bt
* [part_A](graphcol-bt/part_A.ipynb) 
  * loadgraph for dimacs col (do not take it too seriously)
